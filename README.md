Repository title: MiscellaneousAI<br>
Repository description: <b>Cointains miscellaneous code related to learning and solving different problems in Machine Learning, also connected with my blog posts.</b><br>

<b>Short description of mini-projects (alphabetical order):</b>

<b>CNN</b><br>
Convolutional Neural Networks with Pytorch and Keras

<b>Data Preparation with PyTorch</b><br>
This code was written for the purpose of a blog post (https://aigeekprogrammer.com/data-preparation-with-dataset-and-dataloader-in-pytorch/)
It show how we can use PyTorch to load and serve data for machine learning.

<b>Linear Regression</b><br>
Simple case of linear regression using PyTorch and artificially generated data

<b>Logistic Regression</b><br>
Simple case of logistic regression using PyTorch and Scikit Learn on artificially generated blobs of data

<b>Monte Carlo</b><br>
I just play with Monte Carlo method to calculate some probabilities for cards setup in a deck

<b>NN</b><br>
Very simple models in Pytorch that use neural network to solve some basic problems.
